# css-site - view: https://harjuk.github.io/css-site/
## This is a mini-project for my studies, nothing official
 ### visiting the site whilst the viewport is != 1920x1080, the entire webpage scrambles, the same on all mobile devices, regardless of the resolution and orientation. 
 ### since this is just a study project, i am not sure if i will re-visit this project to make it responsive. who knows.
